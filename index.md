## Welcome to... [Shoot The Moon]!

Shoot The Moon is a... game(?) that is generously provided by Kelly at the Brookfield, WI Accelogix office. The goal is to earn the best composite score possible with a maximum of five tries.
This website is a preview of the functionality to come. Not everything you see here is finalized. Please contact Kevin if you have any questions/suggestions.

## Game Rules

- Each player gets 5 tries per day to build the largest composite score.
- Only the first 5 tries will be scored. (This is to prevent players from warming up).
- If a player forfeits any of their 5 turns, they incur a -250 point penalty for that turn.
- If the ball doesn't land in any bucket, a score of 0 points will be awarded for that turn.
- All scores must be witnessed by another (participating) competitor to be counted.
